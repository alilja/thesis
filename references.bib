abstract = {Due to the frequency with which police and fire rescue personnel enter$\backslash$nunfamiliar buildings, and the complex and critical nature of such$\backslash$nspatial navigation tasks, the importance of finding new and improved$\backslash$nways to train route navigation is becoming paramount. The aim of$\backslash$nthe current project is to compare four methods for training police$\backslash$nofficers to acquire and display knowledge about spatial navigation$\backslash$nin an unfamiliar building. Sixty police officers from the Huntsville,$\backslash$nAlabama area will be trained to navigate through the Administrative$\backslash$nScience building at The University of Alabama in Huntsville. The$\backslash$nofficers, who will not have had experience with the Administrative$\backslash$nScience building prior to the experiment: will be randomly assigned$\backslash$nto receive one of four methods for building navigation training:$\backslash$nVerbal Directions, Blueprints, Virtual Reality Training, or Actual$\backslash$nBuilding Training (Control). After training, speed and accuracy of$\backslash$nnavigation in the actual building will be measured. Participants$\backslash$nwill be required to use the shortest route to locate a mock baby$\backslash$n(a life-sized doll) in a fixed location. Once the doll is located,$\backslash$nofficers will be required to leave the building using the nearest$\backslash$nexit. Time taken to locate the doll, time taken to reach the exit,$\backslash$nand errors (wrong turns) made in doing so, will be compared among$\backslash$ngroups by using analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Results will be discussed$\backslash$nwith regard to theories concerning task fidelity and transfer of$\backslash$ntraining, and human performance in virtual environments.},

abstract = {In most work investigating factors influencing the success of analogies in instruction, an underlying assumption is that students have little or no knowledge of the target situation (the situation to be explained by analogy). It is interesting to ask what influences the success of analogies when students believe they understand the target situation. If this understanding is not normative, instruction must aim at conceptual change rather than simply conceptual growth. Through the analysis of four case studies of tutoring interviews (two of which achieved some noticeable conceptual change and two of which did not) we propose a preliminary list of factors important for success in overcoming misconceptions via analogical reasoning. First, there must be a usable anchoring conception. Second, the analogical connection between an anchoring example and the target situation may need to be developed explicitly through processes such as the use of intermediate, ldquobridgingrdquo analogies. Third, it may be necessary to engage the student in a process of analogical reasoning in an interactive teaching environment, rather than simply presenting the analogy in tetext or lecture. Finally, the result of this process may need to be more than analogical transfer of abstract relational structure. The analogies may need to be used to enrich the target situation, leading to the student's construction of a new explanatory model.},

abstract = {Learning involves the integration of new information into existing knowledge. Generoting explanations to oneself (self-explaining) facilitates that integration process. Previously, self-explanation has been shown to improve the acquisition of problem-solving skills when studying worked-out examples. This study extends that finding, showing that self-explanation can also be facilitative when it is explicitly promoted, in the context of learning declarative knowledge from an expository text. Without any extensive training, 14 eighth-grade students were merely asked to self-explain after reading each line of a possage on the human circulatory system. Ten students in the control group read the same text twice, but were not prompted to self-explain. All of the students were tested for their circulatory system knowledge before and after reading the text. The prompted group had a greater gain from the pretest to the posttest. Moreover, prompted students who generated o large number of self-explanations (the high explainers) learned with greater understanding than low explainers. Understanding was assessed by answering very complex questions and inducing the function of a component when it was only implicitly stated. Understanding was further captured by a mental model onolysis of the self-explanation protocols. High explainers all achieved the correct mental model of the circulatory system, whereas many of the unprompted students as well as the low explainers did not. Three processing characteristics of self-explaining are considered as reasons for the gains in deeper understanding. Preparation},

This article presents a detailed analysis of the ways in which scientists and science students respond to such data. We postulate that there are seven distinct forms of response to anomalous data, only one of which is to accept the data and change theories. The other six responses involve discounting the data in various ways in order to protect the preinstructional theory. We analyze the factors that influence which of these seven forms of response a scientist or student will choose, giving special attention to the factors that make theory change more likely. Finally, we discuss the implications of our framework for science instruction.},

Unfortunately, recent research demonstrates only a weak relationship between these indicators of expertise and actual, observed performance. In fact, observed performance does not necessarily correlate with greater professional experience. Expert performance can, however, be traced to active engagement in deliberate practice (DP), where training (often designed and arranged by their teachers and coaches) is focused on improving particular tasks. DP also involves the provision of immediate feedback, time for problem-solving and evaluation, and opportunities for repeated performance to refine behavior. In this article, we draw upon the principles of DP established in other domains, such as chess, music, typing, and sports to provide insight into developing expert performance in medicine.},

In most domains of expertise, individuals begin in their childhood a regimen of effortful activities (deliberate practice) designed to optimize improvement. Individual differences, even among elite performers, are closely related to assessed amounts of deliberate practice. Many characteristics once believed to reflect innate talent are actually the result of intense practice extended for a minimum of 10 yrs.

abstract = {Prior research on conceptual change has identified multiple kinds of misconceptions at different levels of representational complexity including false beliefs, flawed mental models, and incorrect ontological categories. We hypothesized that conceptual change of a mental model requires change in the system of relations between the features of the prior model. To test this hypothesis, we compared instruction aimed at revising knowledge at the mental model level called holistic confrontation - in which the learner compares and contrasts a diagram of his or her flawed mental model to an expert model - to instruction aimed at revising knowledge at the false belief level - in which the learner is prompted to self-explain the expert model alone. We found evidence that participants who engaged in holistic confrontation were more likely to acquire a correct mental model, and a deeper understanding of the systems of relations in the model than those who were prompted to self-explain the expert model. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for science instruction. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

BACKGROUND: NDM research emerged in the 1980s to study how people make decisions in real-world settings. Method: The findings and methods used by NDM researchers are presented along with their implications. RESULTS: The NDM framework emphasizes the role of experience in enabling people to rapidly categorize situations to make effective decisions. CONCLUSION: The NDM focus on field settings and its interest in complex conditions provide insights for human factors practitioners about ways to improve performance. APPLICATION: The NDM approach has been used to improve performance through revisions of military doctrine, training that is focused on decision requirements, and the development of information technologies to support decision making and related cognitive functions.},

In the present paper, the possibility is investigated that there are individual differences in the ability to produce alternative models. The results indicate that some people do not proceed beyond the first model when they reason with syllogisms but that others do. Furthermore, the ability to generate alternatives can be independently measured by asking participants to generate different representations of pairs of premises. These findings support the predictions of mental models theory and also indicate the potential importance of alternatives generation as a measure of individual differences in processing style.},

abstract = {We studied situation awareness as the first part of a decision in a naturalistic setting involving a complex cognitive task . Three measures of situation awareness were used . Further we examined dif ferences in decision making by expert and novice performers , including their use of rules and possible conflicts in using rules . Twenty-eight electronic warfare technicians from U . S . Navy ships were classified as novices , intermediates , or experts according to their performance on a scenario exercise . Results indicated that expertise included proficiency in the following skills : visually and verbally recalling radar emitters that appear on the screen , the ability to make correct decisions based on better situation awareness , and the ability to understand the conditions for applying rules in a consistent manner .},

abstract = {Designers and evaluators of immersive virtual reality systems have many ideas concerning how virtual reality can facilitate learning. However, we have little information concerning which of virtual reality's features provide the most leverage for enhancing understanding or how to customize those affordances for different learning environments. In part, this reflects the truly complex nature of learning. Features of a learning environment do not act in isolation; other factors such as the concepts or skills to be learned, individual characteristics, the learning experience, and the interaction experience all play a role in shaping the learning process and its outcomes. Through Project Science Space, we have been trying to identify, use, and evaluate immersive virtual reality's affordances as a means to facilitate the mastery of complex, abstract concepts. In doing so, we are beginning to understand the interplay between virtual reality's features and other important factors in shaping the learning process ...},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that virtual reality (VR) training transfers technical skills to the operating room (OR) environment. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The use of VR surgical simulation to train skills and reduce error risk in the OR has never been demonstrated in a prospective, randomized, blinded study. METHODS: Sixteen surgical residents (PGY 1-4) had baseline psychomotor abilities assessed, then were randomized to either VR training (MIST VR simulator diathermy task) until expert criterion levels established by experienced laparoscopists were achieved (n = 8), or control non-VR-trained (n = 8). All subjects performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy with an attending surgeon blinded to training status. Videotapes of gallbladder dissection were reviewed independently by two investigators blinded to subject identity and training, and scored for eight predefined errors for each procedure minute (interrater reliability of error assessment r > 0.80). RESULTS: No differences in baseline assessments were found between groups. Gallbladder dissection was 29\% faster for VR-trained residents. Non-VR-trained residents were nine times more likely to transiently fail to make progress (P <.007, Mann-Whitney test) and five times more likely to injure the gallbladder or burn nontarget tissue (chi-square = 4.27, P <.04). Mean errors were six times less likely to occur in the VR-trained group (1.19 vs. 7.38 errors per case; P <.008, Mann-Whitney test). CONCLUSIONS: The use of VR surgical simulation to reach specific target criteria significantly improved the OR performance of residents during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This validation of transfer of training skills from VR to OR sets the stage for more sophisticated uses of VR in assessment, training, error reduction, and certification of surgeons.},

@article{Shanteau1988,
abstract = {<p><br/>Previous studies of expert decision makers have concluded that experts, because of cognitive limitations, are generally inaccurate, unreliable, biased, lack self-insight, and gain little with experience. Overall, previous psychological studies have painted a rather bleak picture of the decision-making abilities of experts. The research reviewed here provides a different view of experts in two respects. First, expert decision makers have been found to use strategies, such as reliance on group feedback, willingness to make adjustments, and a divide-and-conquer approach, which help them overcome the effects of cognitive limitations. Second, top decision makers in agriculture, personnel selection, health care, accounting/auditing, and management have been observed to share psychological characteristics such as perceptiveness, communication skills, self-confidence, and creativity under stress. These findings have implications for (1) image and expectations of experts, (2) classifying different types of experts, (3) training and/or selecting novices to become experts, and (4) design of expert systems.</p>},

@article{Vosniadou1994,
abstract = {A theoretical framework is outlined in this article that attempts to explain the nature of conceptual change that takes place in the learning of physical science. It is argued that a naive framework theory of physics is established early on in infancy and forms the basis of individuals' ontology and epistemology. The presuppositions of this framework theory act as constraints on the way individuals interpret their observations and the information they receive from the culture to construct specific theories about the physical world. The specific theories formed through this process are continuously enriched and modified. Some kinds of conceptual change require the simple addition of new information to an existing conceptual structure. Others are accomplished only when existing beliefs and presuppositions are revised. It is proposed that conceptual change is particularly difficult to achieve and very likely to give rise to misconceptions when it requires the revision of fundamental presuppositions of the framework theory. Misconceptions are interpreted as individuals' attempts to assimilate new information into existing conceptual structures that contain information contradictory to the scientific view.},

abstract = {Sensemaking involves turning circumstances into a situation that is comprehended explicitly in words and that serves as a springboard into action. In this paper we take the position that the concept of sensemaking fills important gaps in organizational theory. The seemingly transient nature of sensemaking belies its central role in the determination of human behavior, whether people are acting in formal organizations or elsewhere. Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept of sensemaking. We do so by pinpointing central features of sensemaking, some of which have been explicated but neglected, some of which have been assumed but not made explicit, some of which have changed in significance over time, and some of which have been missing all along or have gone awry. We sense joint enthusiasm to restate sensemaking in ways that make it more future oriented, more actio...},
