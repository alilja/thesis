\section{Conceptual Change}

Learning is rarely a simple process of simply adding additional, correct information to existing stores of knowledge. Klein and Baxter (2006) describe this as the ``storehouse metaphor,'' where critical information is missing and can simply be taught. Instead, learning typically requires replacing existing, incorrect knowledge with more correct information, especially as learners know increasingly more. The process of correcting errors in knowledge or cognitive skills is known as \emph{conceptual change} (Chi 2008), and involves changes in knowledge on one of three levels: false beliefs, mental models, and ontology (Gadgil, Nokes-Malach, & Chi 2012).
